* python üêç
* nodejs üê¢
* golang ü¶´

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

# Requirements to run the samples ‚úÖ
* Get your secrets:
    * RSO_BASE_URL=https://auth.riotgames.com
    * RSO_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
    * RSO_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
    * DEPLOYMENT_API_KEY=<your-deployment-api-key>
    * APP_BASE_URL=http://<your-app-base-url>
    * APP_CALLBACK_PATH=<your-callback-path>
    * RESPONSE_TYPE=code
    * SCOPE=openid
* Make sure you have your `.env` in the root of the project: `sample_apps/rso_sample_apps/.env` env file is shared between sample apps (go, python, nodejs)
* Add `127.0.0.1       local.exampleapp.com` to your hosts file.
    * MacOS/Linux
    * Append `127.0.0.1       local.exampleapp.com` to the file `/etc/hosts`  
    * Windows
        * Append `127.0.0.1       local.exampleapp.com` to the file `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`  
* Follow the README.md inside every sample app, every sample app.
* Once your app is up and running click the following link to visualize it:
    * http://local.exampleapp.com:3000

# Environment variables ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sample apps use dotenv to load the variables specified in `.env` in your environment.

If you dont want to use dotenv you can set your environment vars manually.

Sample `.env` file
```
RSO_BASE_URL=https://auth.riotgames.com
RSO_CLIENT_ID=riot-example-app
RSO_CLIENT_SECRET=*******************************
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost.riotgames.com:3000
APP_CALLBACK_PATH=/oauth-callback
RESPONSE_TYPE=code
SCOPE=openid
